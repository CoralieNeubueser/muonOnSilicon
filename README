This program draws heavily from several Geant4 examples.
Each file states which example it originates from.

100 GeV muons are shot on a silicon target in an air-filled world.
The PAI model is used (PAI gamma is turned off).
The Penelope Em libraries are used.
The maximum step size in Si is 1 um.

The scoring is done using hits and sensitive detector classes.
The histograms and root trees are done using the histomanager class.

A messenger for the detector construction is implemented to change the Si thickness.
